## Commercial Land Use
Can be a subtype of [Commercial Land Use]() and influences its density.

* Area Requirement per plot: 20,000-70,000 sqm

## Location
An open market can be an elemental part of a city, it needs space and can allow inhabitants to gather in public. Therefore, its location can be specified early on in the city development process. Its location can be placed within [Land Use Distribution](), but also manually assisted by [Evaluation Score]() or through i.e. [Force-based Distribution](). Assisted with the [Boundary]() module, a site can be defined that is considering the context.

* Can be kept close to primary roads or city center for fast access and good connection to logistics and industry. A connection to worship places might be considerable.
